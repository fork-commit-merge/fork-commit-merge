*Note: You don't have to ask a permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to always be open for new contributors. You can just simply start working with the issue right away! Remember that in real world issues you would usually need to ask permission to get assigned to certain issue to prevent multiple people to working on the same issue at the same time, which would result some contributors wasting their time.*

## Best Practices

Programming languages, despite their diverse syntax and underlying paradigms, universally emphasize the importance of adhering to best practices. These practices evolve over time, influenced by shared challenges faced by developers, innovations in the field, and the inherent features and limitations of the languages themselves. This section serves as a compass, guiding you through the idiomatic ways of coding in various languages, ensuring not only that your code works but also that it aligns with the conventions and norms of the community.

Why Follow Best Practices?

-   Readability: Code is read more often than it's written. Adopting best practices ensures your code remains accessible and comprehensible to other developers, or even to your future self!

-   Maintainability: Idiomatic code, by adhering to established patterns and standards, is easier to update, debug, and expand upon.

-   Performance: Often, best practices evolve in response to the understanding of a language's performance characteristics. Writing idiomatic code might also mean squeezing the best performance out of your programs.

-   Community Support: If you're writing code in the way that the broader community expects, you're more likely to receive help when you run into issues. Moreover, you can benefit from tools, linters, and extensions built with these practices in mind.

-   Reducing Errors: Many best practices are born from the lessons of countless debugged issues. By adhering to them, you’re sidestepping many pitfalls before they even occur.

In this section, you'll find guides tailored to various languages. Whether you're dabbling in a new language or revisiting a familiar one, these insights will help ensure your code is elegant, efficient, and effective.

### JavaScript Best Practices and Coding Style Guide

-   Variable Declaration:
    -   Use let for block-scoped variables. Avoid var.
    -   Use const for values that won't change.

-   Functions:
    -   Prefer arrow functions for short, non-method functions.
    -   Use default parameters instead of manually checking and setting a default inside the function.

-   Objects and Arrays:
    -   Use object destructuring to extract properties from objects.
    -   Use array destructuring to extract items from arrays.
    -   Use the spread operator (...) to clone or merge arrays and objects.

-   Promises and Asynchronous Code:
    -   Always handle promise rejections. Use .catch() or async/await with try-catch blocks.
    -   Use async/await for more readable asynchronous code, especially when there are multiple steps involved.

-   Loops:
    -   Prefer Array methods like map, filter, and reduce over traditional for loops.

-   Type Checking:
    -   Use typeof and instanceof wisely. Remember, typeof null is "object".
    -   Use triple equals (===) over double equals (==) to avoid unexpected type coercion.

-   Modules:
    -   Use ES6 modules (import/export) over older module systems.

-   Linters:
    -   Use tools like ESLint to catch potential problems and enforce style consistency.

### TypeScript Best Practices and Coding Style Guide

-   Strong Typing:
    -   Always prefer to provide specific types over using the any type.
    -   Use interfaces for defining the shape of objects.

-   Type Inference:
    -   Allow TypeScript to infer types whenever possible. For instance, prefer const foo = "bar" over const foo: string = "bar".

-   Enums:
    -   Use string enums for better debugging and readability.

-   Generics:
    -   Use generics to create reusable components and utility functions, ensuring type safety without sacrificing flexibility.

-   Type Guards:
    -   Use type guards to narrow down types in a specific scope, especially when dealing with union types.

-   Type Aliases:
    -   Use type aliases to create your own custom types, especially for complex types used in multiple places.

-   Access Modifiers:
    -   Explicitly mark properties and methods with public, private, or protected to indicate their intended accessibility.

-   Linter and Config:
    -   Use TSLint or ESLint with TypeScript support. Ensure you have a good tsconfig.json.

-   Always Use strict Mode:
    -   Enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json for stricter type-checking.

-   Type Definitions:
    -   When using third-party libraries, ensure you have the appropriate type definitions installed, often available as @types/package-name.

### Ruby Best Practices and Coding Style Guide

-   Indentation and Whitespace:
    -   Use two spaces per indentation level, no tabs.
    -   Avoid trailing whitespace.
    -   Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons, and semicolons.

-   Naming:
    -   Use snake_case for methods and variables.
    -   Use CamelCase for classes and modules.
    -   Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
    -   Use a trailing underscore for unused block parameters or variables (e.g., do |used_var, _|).

-   Methods:
    -   Prefer methods with clear names over using comments.
    -   Use def with parentheses when there are parameters.
    -   Avoid methods longer than 10 LOC (Lines of Code).

-   Strings:
    -   Prefer string interpolation over string concatenation.
    -   Use single-quoted strings unless you need double quotes for interpolation or special characters.
    -   Avoid using String#+ when modifying a string. Instead, use String#<<.

-   Blocks:
    -   Use {...} for single-line blocks. Use do..end for multi-line blocks.
    -   Prefer &:method_name for simple block operations (array.map(&:method_name)).

-   Hashes:
    -   Use the Ruby 1.9 hash literal syntax when your hash keys are symbols: { key: value } instead of {:key => value}.
    -   Prefer symbols over strings as hash keys.

-   Arrays:
    -   Use %w or %W for arrays of words without spaces. Like %w(apple orange grape).
    -   For array literals, use square brackets. For example: array = [1, 2, 3].

-   Control Flow:
    -   Use && and || for logical expressions.
    -   Use unless instead of if !.
    -   Avoid multi-line ?: (the ternary operator); use if/unless instead.

-   Error Handling:
    -   Prefer exceptions from the standard library over introducing new exception classes.
    -   Always specify which exceptions you're catching.

-   Comments:
    -   Write self-explanatory code and only comment when necessary.
    -   Start comments with a space and use consistent capitalization.

-   Gems and Dependencies:
    -   Be judicious about adding new gems; each addition increases your technical debt.
    -   Use the latest stable version of Ruby and libraries.

-   Testing:
    -   Aim for thorough test coverage, but don't be dogmatic about it.
    -   Use factories and not fixtures.

-   Performance:
    -   Write clear and readable code first, then optimize.
    -   Use the built-in Ruby methods and libraries for common operations.

-   Linting and Formatting:
    -   Use tools like [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) to enforce style and linting rules. Configure it according to your team's preferences.

Official Ruby documentation:

### Rust Best Practices and Coding Style Guide

-   Ownership and Borrowing:
    -   Always try to use references (&) when you don't need to take ownership of a value.
    -   Be explicit with lifetimes where required, but rely on Rust's lifetime elision rules whenever possible to keep code concise.

-   Immutability:
    -   Prefer immutability by default. Use let to create immutable bindings and let mut only when you need to mutate the value.

-   Error Handling:
    -   Use the Result type for functions that can fail. Avoid using unwrap() and expect() unless you're absolutely certain the Result is Ok or the Option is Some.
    -   Prefer the ? operator for propagating errors in most situations.

-   Use of Enums:
    -   Use enums to represent data that can be one of several variants. This is much more idiomatic in Rust than, for instance, class hierarchies in object-oriented languages.

-   Match Statement:
    -   Use match statements for pattern matching. It's exhaustive, ensuring every possible case is handled.

-   Clippy:
    -   Use clippy, the Rust linting tool. It provides a lot of suggestions and idiomatic ways to write Rust code. You can use it with cargo clippy.

-   Formatting:
    -   Run cargo fmt before committing to ensure your code conforms to the Rust community coding standards.

-   Use of Crates:
    -   Don't reinvent the wheel. If there's a well-maintained crate (Rust's term for libraries) that does what you need, consider using it. But also be wary of adding too many dependencies.

-   Documentation:
    -   Document public APIs with triple-slash /// comments. Use markdown inside these comments.

-   Concurrency:

    -   Make use of Rust's powerful concurrency guarantees. The borrow checker will help you a lot here. When shared state is needed, prefer using types like Mutex or RwLock from the standard library.

    -   Tests:

        -   Write unit tests using Rust's built-in testing framework. Put tests in a mod tests block within your source files and use the #[test] attribute for test functions.

    -   Avoiding unsafe:

        -   Rust offers the unsafe keyword to bypass the borrow checker. While it's there for valid use-cases, use it sparingly and always document the exact reason and ensure that the surrounding code truly upholds the safety guarantees.

    -   Performance:

        -   Rust allows for great performance, but always remember: write clear and readable code first, then optimize. With Rust, it's often the case that more idiomatic code is also faster, thanks to compiler optimizations.

    -   Keep Cargo.toml Clean:

        -   Regularly check your dependencies and remove any that you aren't using. This reduces compile time, binary size, and potential security risks.
