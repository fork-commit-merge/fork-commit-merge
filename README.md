### Installing an IDE

#### What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that consolidates basic tools required for software testing and development. An IDE typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs, like Android Studio or Visual Studio, even offer more advanced features such as version control, databases, cloud services, and more. Why use an IDE? Using an IDE can significantly speed up the development process by offering a variety of tools and features under one roof.

Here are a few reasons why developers use IDEs:

-   Efficiency: With everything in one place, developers can write, test, and debug code without needing to switch between different tools.

-   Code Assistance: Many IDEs offer features like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and suggestions, making the code-writing process smoother.

-   Integrated Debugging: Integrated debuggers allow developers to test and debug their programs within the IDE, speeding up the development cycle.

-   Extensions & Plugins: Most modern IDEs support a wide range of extensions and plugins, enabling developers to customize their environment and add even more functionalities.

We recommend using VS Code as your IDE for this project. It's free, open-source, and supports a wide range of languages and extensions. You can download it from the [VS Code - Official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, if you prefer to use another IDE, that's fine too!

Instructions of how to install an IDE that suits for you can be found in our website at [forkcommitmerge.io/ide](https://forkcommitmerge.io/ide)!

### Installing Lisp

Install SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp):

Depending on your OS, you can follow the instructions on the [Official SBCL website](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) to install SBCL.

Install the Lisp Extension for VS Code:

-   Open Visual Studio Code.
-   Go to Extensions.
-   Search for Lisp and install any Lisp extension you like. Usually the one that has the most downloads is the most safest.

Set Up Your Lisp Environment (Windows):

After installing the extension, you may need to set up your Lisp environment by pointing it to your SBCL installation. You need to adjust the configuration (settings.json) and set the lisp.sbcl.path to the path where SBCL is installed.

### Installing Fortran

#### Installing Fortran Compiler:

Depending on your OS, here's how you install the Fortran compiler:

**Windows:**

-   Download and install the [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) compiler which includes Fortran.
-   Add the bin directory of your MinGW-w64 installation to your PATH environment variable.

**Linux:**

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gfortran
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc-fortran
```

**macOS:**

If you have Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gcc
```

Setting up Visual Studio Code:

-   Install Visual Studio Code.
-   Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
-   Search for and install the "Modern Fortran" extension for Fortran support.
-   For better integration, you can also install the "Code Runner" extension which will allow you to run your Fortran code directly from VS Code.

---

### Installing Erlang

**Windows:**

-   Download the installer from the official Erlang website: [Erlang Downloads](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
-   Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

**Linux:**
Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install erlang
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S erlang
```

**macOS:**

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install erlang
```

Setting up VS Code extension:

-   Search for erlang and install the Erlang extension provided by "Pierrick Gourlain".

---

-   Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
-   Add the bin directory inside the extracted folder to your system's PATH.

**Linux:**

The command depends on your distribution.

For example, on Ubuntu/Debian, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zig
```

In Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S zig
```

Setting up VS Code extension:

-   Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).

### Installing sqlite3

#### macOS and Linux:

SQLite comes pre-installed on macOS and most Linux distributions. To verify if sqlite3 is installed, you can open a terminal and type:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

If SQLite is installed, this will output the version number.

#### Windows:

To install SQLite on Windows:

-   Visit the SQLite download page.
-   In the "Precompiled Binaries for Windows" section, download the `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-xxxxxx.zip` file.
-   Unzip the downloaded file. It will create a directory named `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-xxxxxx`.
-   Move the directory to `C:\` (or another location if you prefer) and rename it to `sqlite`.
-   Add `C:\sqlite` to your PATH environment variable.

To check whether SQLite has been installed successfully, open Terminal window and run:

```bash
sqlite3 --version
```

This should output the version number if SQLite is installed correctly.

Note that the terminal in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) uses your system's PATH, so once you've added SQLite to your PATH as described above, you'll be able to use SQLite in the VS Code terminal.

---

### Installing TLA+ Toolbox

**The TLA Toolbox is an IDE (integrated development environment) for the TLA+ tools.**

Install the TLA+ Toolbox: This is the standard IDE for TLA+. You can download it from [here](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html).

Install the TLA+ extension for Visual Studio Code from the VS Code marketplace.

---

### Installing Bash

Ensure you have a UNIX-like environment. If you're on Linux or MacOS, you're already set. Windows users might want to look into [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or use Git Bash, which you should already have in your machine if you have installed [Git](#installing-git).

---

### Installing Perl

-   Windows: Use Strawberry Perl. Download the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
-   macOS: Perl comes pre-installed. You can check its version by typing perl -v in your terminal.
-   Linux: Depending on your distribution, you can use your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use `sudo apt-get install perl` and in Arch Linux `sudo pacman -S perl`.

Setting up VS Code for Perl:

-   Search for the extension "Perl" in VS Code's extensions marketplace and install it for syntax highlighting and basic debugging support.

_Note: You don't have to ask a permission to start solving the issue or get assigned, since these issues are supposed to always be open for new contributors. You can just simply start working with the issue right away! Remember that in real world issues you would usually need to ask permission to get assigned to certain issue to prevent multiple people to working on the same issue at the same time, which would result some contributors wasting their time._

## Best Practices

Programming languages, despite their diverse syntax and underlying paradigms, universally emphasize the importance of adhering to best practices. These practices evolve over time, influenced by shared challenges faced by developers, innovations in the field, and the inherent features and limitations of the languages themselves. This section serves as a compass, guiding you through the idiomatic ways of coding in various languages, ensuring not only that your code works but also that it aligns with the conventions and norms of the community.

Why Follow Best Practices?

-   Readability: Code is read more often than it's written. Adopting best practices ensures your code remains accessible and comprehensible to other developers, or even to your future self!

-   Maintainability: Idiomatic code, by adhering to established patterns and standards, is easier to update, debug, and expand upon.

-   Performance: Often, best practices evolve in response to the understanding of a language's performance characteristics. Writing idiomatic code might also mean squeezing the best performance out of your programs.

-   Community Support: If you're writing code in the way that the broader community expects, you're more likely to receive help when you run into issues. Moreover, you can benefit from tools, linters, and extensions built with these practices in mind.

-   Reducing Errors: Many best practices are born from the lessons of countless debugged issues. By adhering to them, you’re sidestepping many pitfalls before they even occur.

In the [Best Practices](https://forkcommitmerge.io/best-practices) section of our website, you'll find guides tailored to various languages. Whether you're dabbling in a new language or revisiting a familiar one, these insights will help ensure your code is elegant, efficient, and effective.
